### Project overview
Have you ever seen that poster of the grizzly bear with the salmon in its mouth, subcaptioned "Sometimes the journey of 1000 miles ends very, very badly"?
Well \[spoiler alert\], this is one of those journeys. The OBD-II interface that I spent about 10 months hacking - relatively successfully -
is no longer used in cars. So if you want to skip this one, feel free. Otherwise, I'll take you on my torturous journey to hack the car.
