*Summer is here*

### How long is the berry season, anyways?
The date is Sunday, June 29th 2014. For some reason, we have a blackberry bush in our front yard & counted 60 unripe berries. Score. But how long until they ripen? Well, we started doing a daily count
and found out they're basically all ripe within 2 weeks.

*What is our RR? (ripening rate)*

Now, we weren't super scientific this first year, so we upped our game in 2015 ... learn by (re)doing.
The season was earlier by about a week in 2015 ... here's the data:

*Berry good data in 2015*

Yes, there were more berries in 2015 & there were a few error bars here and there (ahem ... Kai) but our initial estimate of 400 berries was pretty darn close, & I was fascinated by that S-curve. The final stats:

> 2 week season, starting last week of June through 2nd week of July

> 7 days from first ripe berry to the "berries-galore" knee in the S-curve

> 7 days from hitting "berries-galore" to end of season

There you have it.

### Do you have to make everything soooo boring?
No.

Yum.
