### A really cool Christmas present

After many years of bike mechani*cry*, with *cry* being the operative word, 
I was paid back in spades with this really cool homemade bike stand. My son (pictured above
at 2017 cyclocross nationals in Hartford) was the brainchild here - he built it all himself
from scratch with the sawdust flying until late on Christmas Eve.

Pretty cool, eh? Now maybe I can learn how to expertly true a wheel ... I've got a basement full of 'em. 

Check back for updates on progress.
